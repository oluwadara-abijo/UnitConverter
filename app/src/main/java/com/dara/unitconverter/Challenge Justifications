If I had more time, I would have implemented the two-way conversion by updating the
state values when the swap icon is clicked, and then automatically performing the
conversion using the same input. I eventually implemented it in a new branch
named two-way-conversion.

I used AI for a couple of things - mostly to document my functions. I also used it to
generate the conversion functions for temperature, length and mass to save time.
